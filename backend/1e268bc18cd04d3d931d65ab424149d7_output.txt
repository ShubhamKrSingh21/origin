CS 170 is Berkeley’s introduction to the theory of computer science.

In CS 170, we will study the design and analysis of graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, linear programming, fast matrix multiplication, Fourier transforms, number theory, complexity, and NP-completeness.

The prerequisites for CS 170 are CS 61B and CS70.

You will need to be comfortable with mathematical induction, big-O notation, basic data structures, and programming in a standard imperative language (e.g., Java/C/Python).

Another “prerequisite” for doing well in the course is mathematical maturity, or the ability to think about and work with proof-based math (which CS70 can help build).

The primary methods for engaging with the course material are through lectures, discussion sections, homework, and the readings.

All are important, and exams will test a mix of the material from these sources.

Lectures will be held in Lewis 100 every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 11:00am to 11:59am.

They might be Zoom streamed and will be asynchronously recorded.

There is no discussion in the first week.

Details for the specific times will be decided and announced on Ed.

Attendance at discussion sections is not required, although sections cover important material not covered in lecture that will appear on exams. You may attend any discussion section!

Outside of your discussion section, you should feel free to attend any of the staff office hours (not just your section TA’s office hours) and ask any of us for help.

The textbook for this course is Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani, also known as DPV.

The relevant textbook sections will be linked for each lecture.

TA office hours are a fantastic resource for questions about concepts, course material including homework, and study tips.

The instructors’ office hours are best for major concerns or high-level questions about the course material.

We prioritize conceptual questions over homework questions in office hours.

Every Tuesday evening, homework is posted on Ed, and it is due the following Monday by 10:00 PM.

Please see the homework guidelines to see how to answer homework questions and format your homework submissions.

You may lose points for not properly following the homework guidelines.

Exams will be conducted in person.

We are not planning on offering alternate exams or remote exams. Exam-specific policy will be released closer to the exam dates.

The class will be curved at the end of the semester.

There is no clobbering policy, but we may take into account participation on Ed, discussion, office hours, HW Party and student performance when considering students on grade borderlines.

Regrading of homeworks or exams will only be undertaken in cases where you believe there has been a genuine error or misunderstanding.

Any requests for grade changes or re-grading must be made by the deadline.

Submit regrade requests via Gradescope.

Before making a request please make sure that you read Regrade Etiquette.

We may offer optional activities that provide a small amount of extra credit, for those eager for a tougher challenge.
