Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.

The meaning of financial literacy is the foundation of your relationship with money, and it is a lifelong journey of learning.

The earlier you start, the better off you will be because education is the key to success when it comes to money.

In recent decades financial products and services have become increasingly widespread throughout society.

Whereas earlier generations of Americans may have purchased goods primarily in cash, various credit products are popular today, such as credit and debit cards and electronic transfers.

A 2021 survey by the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco revealed 28% of all payments were via credit card, with only 20% being made in cash.

Given the importance of finance in modern society, lacking financial literacy can be very damaging to an individual’s long-term financial success.

Unfortunately, research has shown that financial illiteracy is very common, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) attributing it to 66% of Americans.

Being financially illiterate can lead to a number of pitfalls, such as being more likely to accumulate unsustainable debt burdens, either through poor spending decisions or a lack of long-term preparation.

This, in turn, can lead to poor credit, bankruptcy, housing foreclosure, and other negative consequences.

Thankfully, there are now more resources than ever for those wishing to educate themselves about the world of finance.

One such example is the government-sponsored Financial Literacy and Education Commission, which offers a range of free learning resources.

Financial literacy can help protect individuals from becoming victims of financial fraud, a type of crime that is becoming more commonplace.

Although there are many skills that might fall under the umbrella of financial literacy, popular examples include household budgeting, learning how to manage and pay off debts, and evaluating the tradeoffs between different credit and investment products.

These skills often require at least a working knowledge of key financial concepts, such as compound interest and the time value of money.

Other products, such as mortgages, student loans, health insurance, and self-directed investment accounts, have also grown in importance.

This has made it even more imperative for individuals to understand how to use them responsibly.

Financial literacy also covers short-term financial strategy as well as long-term financial strategy.

Financial literacy encompasses knowing how investment decisions made today will impact your tax liabilities in the future.

This also includes knowing which investment vehicles are best to use when saving for retirement.

From day-to-day expenses to long-term budget forecasting, financial literacy is crucial for managing these factors.

As mentioned above, it is important to plan and save enough to provide adequate income in retirement while avoiding high levels of debt that might result in bankruptcy, defaults, and foreclosures.

Yet, in its Economic Well-Being of U.S.

Households in 2020 report, the U.S.

Federal Reserve System Board of Governors found that many Americans are unprepared for retirement.

Over one-fourth indicated they have no retirement savings, and fewer than four in 10 of those not yet retired felt that their retirement savings are on track.

Among those who have self-directed retirement savings, more than 60% admitted to feeling low levels of confidence in making retirement decisions.

Low financial literacy has left Millennials—the largest share of the American workforce—unprepared for a severe financial crisis, according to research by the TIAA Institute.

Even among those who report having a high knowledge of personal finance, only 19% answered questions about fundamental financial concepts correctly.

Forty-three percent report using expensive alternative financial services, such as payday loans and pawnshops.
