When it comes to understanding a business, there are few financial statements more important than the balance sheet.

Whether you’re a business owner, employee, or investor, understanding how to read and understand the information in a balance sheet is an essential financial accounting skill to have.

Here’s everything you need to know about understanding a balance sheet, including what it is, the information it contains, why it’s so important, and the underlying mechanics of how it works.

A balance sheet is a financial document designed to communicate exactly how much a company or organization is worth—its so-called “book value.” The balance sheet achieves this by listing out and tallying up all of a company’s assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity as of a particular date, also known as the “reporting date."

Typically, a balance sheet will be prepared and distributed on a quarterly or monthly basis, depending on the frequency of reporting as determined by law or company policy.

A balance sheet provides a summary of a business at a given point in time.

It’s a snapshot of a company’s financial position, as broken down into assets, liabilities, and equity.

Balance sheets serve two very different purposes depending on the audience reviewing them.

When a balance sheet is reviewed internally by a business leader, key stakeholder, or employee, it’s designed to give insight into whether a company is succeeding or failing.

Based on this information, an internal audience can shift their policies and approach: doubling down on successes, correcting failures, and pivoting toward new opportunities.

When a balance sheet is reviewed externally by someone interested in a company, it’s designed to give insight into what resources are available to a business and how they were financed.

Based on this information, potential investors can decide whether it would be wise to invest in a company.

Similarly, it’s possible to leverage the information in a balance sheet to calculate important metrics, such as liquidity, profitability, and debt-to-equity ratio.

External auditors, on the other hand, might use a balance sheet to ensure a company is complying with any reporting laws it’s subject to.

It’s important to remember that a balance sheet communicates information as of a specific date.

By its very nature, a balance sheet is always based upon past data.

While investors and stakeholders may use a balance sheet to predict future performance, past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The information found in a balance sheet will most often be organized according to the following equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity.

While this equation is the most common formula for balance sheets, it isn’t the only way of organizing the information.

A balance sheet should always balance.

Assets must always equal liabilities plus owners’ equity.

Owners’ equity must always equal assets minus liabilities.

Liabilities must always equal assets minus owners’ equity.

If a balance sheet doesn’t balance, it’s likely the document was prepared incorrectly.
