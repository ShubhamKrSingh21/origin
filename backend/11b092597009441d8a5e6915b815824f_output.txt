According to many chess players, chess opening strategies determine the fate of the game.

However, for some players, it’s the endgame strategy that seals the deal.

Dear readers, I think, when it comes to this discussion, the middle game is the most crucial phase of a game of chess.

Although an opening strategy sets the course of the chess game and an endgame strategy shows the outcome, the middle game is what the game is about.

After all, in the middle game, you attack and exchange pieces.

This is where you shape your destiny in the chess game.

In short, your win majorly depends on what your middle strategy is.

Even though your opening moves aren’t good enough or you didn’t pull off your planned chess strategy, remember that the middle game is all you have.

Learning chess middlegame strategies and perfecting them is one of the primary jobs a chess beginner must do.

But, hey, I am not here to scare or warn you about middlegames.

I am here with 8 middlegame strategies & tips that every beginner chess player should learn.

Before reading the blog, take a quick look at this video.

Now, you might have a question.

Isn’t the pawn structure something that you do in the chess opening?

Yes, indeed.

It’s your job to structure your pawns strategically during the opening of the game.

However, the importance of the same remains equally crucial even during the middlegame.

Make sure you don’t have an isolated pawn during the middlegame.

Any isolated pawn is a piece of cake for your opponent’s pieces.

Your enemy player might find an unexpected path to checkmate your King through the isolated pawn.

In your case, I suggest blocking the enemy isolated pawns with knights.

Avoid Doubled Pawns during the middlegame.

Even though sometimes, doubles pawns are a great way to develop pieces, like rook and bishop, I suggest you avoid doubled pawns.

Each pawn can be helpful during the middle game.

Avoiding doubles pawns will provide opportunities to use each pawn differently.

Always keep an eye on your enemy’s passed pawns.

It doesn’t matter if it’s protected or outside passed pawns.

At the same time, the middlegame is the perfect time to advance your passed pawns.

With just a little attention, a passed pawn can become a queen on reaching the 8th row.

Try to keep your pieces centralized, especially knights and bishops.
