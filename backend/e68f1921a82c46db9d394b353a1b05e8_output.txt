This pervasive and powerful form of artificial intelligence is changing every industry.

Here’s what you need to know about the potential and limitations of machine learning and how it’s being used.

Machine learning is behind chatbots and predictive text, language translation apps, the shows Netflix suggests to you, and how your social media feeds are presented.

It powers autonomous vehicles and machines that can diagnose medical conditions based on images.

When companies today deploy artificial intelligence programs, they are most likely using machine learning — so much so that the terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes ambiguously.

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.

With the growing ubiquity of machine learning, everyone in business is likely to encounter it and will need some working knowledge about this field.

A 2020 Deloitte survey found that 67% of companies are using machine learning, and 97% are using or planning to use it in the next year.

From manufacturing to retail and banking to bakeries, even legacy companies are using machine learning to unlock new value or boost efficiency.

Machine learning is changing, or will change, every industry, and leaders need to understand the basic principles, the potential, and the limitations,” said MIT computer science professor Aleksander Madry, director of the MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning.

While not everyone needs to know the technical details, they should understand what the technology does and what it can and cannot do, Madry added.

That includes being aware of the social, societal, and ethical implications of machine learning.
